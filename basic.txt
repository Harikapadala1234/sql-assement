1. History of SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) was developed by IBM in the 1970s.
It was later standardized by ANSI and ISO.
SQL is used to store, retrieve, update, and manage data in databases.

2. Database
A database is an organized collection of data stored in electronic form.
It allows easy storage, retrieval, and management of large amounts of data.

Example: Student records, bank details, employee data.

3. Data
Data is raw facts and figures that have no meaning by themselves.
When data is processed, it becomes information.

Example:
Data → 56, Harika, CSE
Information → Student Harika scored 56 marks in CSE.

4. DBMS (Database Management System)
DBMS is software used to create, store, manage, and retrieve data from databases.
It acts as an interface between the user and the database.

Examples: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server.

5. Drawbacks of DBMS
Data redundancy (duplicate data)

Data inconsistency

Poor security

Difficult data relationships

Limited multi-user support

6. RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
RDBMS is an advanced version of DBMS.
Data is stored in the form of tables (rows and columns) and related using keys.

Examples: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL.

7. Table
A table is a collection of data arranged in rows and columns.
Each table stores data about a single entity.

Example: Student table.

8. Row (Record)
A row represents a single record in a table.
Each row contains complete information about one item.

Example: One student’s details.

9. Column (Attribute)
A column represents a specific field in a table.
Each column contains the same type of data.

Example: name, age, marks.

10. Field / Fieldset
Field: A single piece of data in a table (intersection of row and column).

Fieldset: A collection of related fields.

11. SQL
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
It is used to communicate with databases to perform operations like insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.

SQL is not a database, it is a language.

12. MySQL
MySQL is an open-source RDBMS developed by Oracle Corporation.
It uses SQL language and is widely used for web applications.

13. Difference between SQL and MySQL
SQL	                   MySQL
SQL is a language	MySQL is a database software
Used to write queries	Used to store and manage data
Standard language	Implementation of SQL
Cannot store data	Can store data
